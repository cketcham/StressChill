This repository tracks the source code to the WeTap water quality survey
application. Currently, the only available client implementation runs on the
android and the only server implementation runs on appengine.

See the appropriate android and appengine documentation for instructions on how
to build and deploy the code on each platform.

# Android Notes

To build the Android application without Eclipse (the .apk) you will need to
update StressChill/android with the `android' tool. I've included a small
script to do this for you. From StressChill/ run:

    ./tools/update-build-files.sh

This will update almost all of the necessary files.


For whatever reason, `android' does not update
StressChill/android/default.properties correctly. You will need to open up that
file and change the last line to

    target=Google Inc.:Google APIs:3

This may vary depending on which target you are building for.
